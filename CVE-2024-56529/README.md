# Session fixation vulnerability in the MailCow web panel
- Author: Mohammad Mortazavi
- Product: MailCow
- Version: <= 2024-11b
- CVE ID: CVE-2024-56529
- Type: WebApps

It allows remote attackers to set a session identifier when **HSTS** is disabled on a victim's browser. After a user logs in, user is authenticated and the session identifier is valid. Then, a remote attacker can access the victim's web panel with the same session identifier.

## PoC

Without invalidating any existing session identifier on login page, it will validate existing session identifier on browser and it could give an attacker the opportunity when HSTS is not set. Just you need to set your **PHPSESSID** on browser before login, It'll validate session identifier.

Now, We can use **1** as a validated **PHPSESSID** and log into the MailCow web panel.
